1. While matching the output exactly can cause many headaches and a very long time to get right in some cases, especially
when the program has invisible output (white-space) expected, matching the output exactly requires us to write the program
within the exact specification provided. This likely is a requirement to help to set us up for future programming careers
that expect a program to be created precisely within a pre-defined specification. This introduces programming with order
instead of simply allowing a program to be made in whatever manner we feel. This also could help when working with a team, as
all team members will know what output to expect from my portion of the program and the design will be uniform.

2. When naming a module or library, one must consider if the name describes the functions and structures that
are available within it. In a program with multiple modules, quite like this one, it can be confusing to identify what
is contained within each module/library's code at first glance. Naming header and source files the same thing also ties into
this concept as you will always be able to quickly identify which source file contains the function definitions matching the
prototypes of the header file. Being able to easily identify what files contain within a project is essential to keeping it
organized, allowing for bugs to be more easily tracked down and for new function definitions to be placed in the right spot
without confusion.

3. A cascading menu framework is an application in which user interaction is used to navigate between multiple nested menus.
One such example from this program is how the user is able to change an account's data. First they are presented with a menu to login.
After this, the user is presented with the main menu in which they select "2" to modify the account. After inputting a user ID, a menu
is presented to select what data to update. This type of menu system allows the user to navigate a system of logically-nested
menus that can display dynamic data based on previous selections.
